									</header>
									<p>
									The Security and Risk Management Module is designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of security and risk management in enterprises. It emphasizes the interconnectedness of security and risk, and explores how to manage risks effectively while ensuring the security of the organization's assets. 
									The module begins by examining the various areas where security and risk overlap and interact with each other. It highlights the importance of taking an integrated approach to security and risk management, rather than treating them as separate entities.
									Next, the module discusses various methods of risk assessment, including qualitative and quantitative methods. It covers the strengths and limitations of each method, and helps learners understand how to choose the most appropriate approach for their organization.
									The module also reviews a number of traditional risk models, such as STRIDE, DREAD, and Attack Trees, as well as hybrid models. By understanding these models, learners will have a better understanding of how to identify and prioritize risks in their organization.
									The module also covers common security standards such as PCI-DSS, which is a set of standards designed to ensure that organizations that accept credit card payments maintain a secure environment. It also examines business continuity and disaster recovery solutions, which help organizations prepare for and respond to unexpected events.
									Finally, the module discusses some of the key research topics and advances driving the fields of security and risk management. This includes emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence and blockchain, as well as new risk management frameworks and methodologies. By staying up-to-date with these advances, learners will be better equipped to manage security and risk in their organizations.

												<h3>Week 1</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												Security and risk management are essential concepts in the fields of business, technology, and information security. According to the Harvard Business Review, security and risk management involve identifying and assessing potential risks, developing strategies to mitigate those risks, and implementing measures to monitor and control them (Schoemaker & Day, 2019). Some common security and risk management concepts include identifying threats and vulnerabilities, assessing the likelihood and potential impact of risks, and implementing controls to reduce those risks (Kizza, 2019).<br><br>

												The risk management process typically consists of several steps, including risk identification, risk assessment, risk prioritization, risk treatment, and risk monitoring (Peltier, 2016). During the risk identification phase, potential risks are identified and classified based on their likelihood and potential impact. The risk assessment phase involves evaluating the likelihood and potential impact of each identified risk. Risk prioritization involves ranking the risks based on their potential impact and likelihood of occurrence. The risk treatment phase involves developing and implementing strategies to mitigate the identified risks. Finally, the risk monitoring phase involves ongoing monitoring and control of the identified risks to ensure that they are effectively managed over time.<br><br>

												<h3>Week 2</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												This summary discusses Risk Management Process (RMP), the effects of different assessment types (Qualitative vs. Quantitative), and potential changes to the RMP based on changes in user participation. Risk Management Process (RMP) is a systematic approach to identifying, assessing, and mitigating risks. Qualitative assessment involves a subjective analysis of risks based on expert judgment, while quantitative assessment involves a numerical analysis of risks based on statistical data. Both types of assessments have their advantages and disadvantages, and the selection of the assessment type depends on the context of the risk being assessed. Changes in user participation can have a significant impact on the RMP, and it is essential to consider these changes while designing and implementing the RMP.<br><br>

												According to Smith and Merritt (2002), "Risk management is a process designed to reduce or eliminate the risk of certain kinds of events happening or having an impact on the organization" (p. 8).<br><br>

												The selection of the assessment type depends on the context of the risk being assessed. As noted by Hubbard (2009), "Qualitative assessments are better suited for risks that are difficult to quantify due to a lack of data or uncertainty, while quantitative assessments are more appropriate for risks that can be measured using statistical data" (p. 75).<br><br>

												Changes in user participation can have a significant impact on the RMP. As stated by Olson, Wainwright, and Williamson (2014), "User participation plays a critical role in the success of the RMP, and changes in user participation can result in changes in the risk profile of the organization" (p. 103).<br><br>

												<h3> Week 3</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												Threats and vulnerabilities are two important concepts in cybersecurity. Threats refer to potential attacks that can exploit vulnerabilities in a system, while vulnerabilities are weaknesses or flaws in a system that can be exploited by threats. Threat modelling is a process that helps identify potential threats and vulnerabilities in a system and provides a structured approach to addressing them. There are various threat modelling techniques that can be used, such as STRIDE, DREAD, PASTA, and VAST. Guides and cookbooks can also be helpful resources for organizations that want to implement threat modelling.<br><br>

											<p>
												Threat modelling and management is a crucial activity in ensuring the security of computer systems and networks. There are various tools and resources that can be used in threat modelling and management, including publicly available tools. Publicly available tools can assist with different aspects of threat modelling, such as identifying assets, threats, and vulnerabilities, as well as assessing the risk associated with various threats.

												One such tool is the Microsoft Threat Modelling Tool, which provides a framework for identifying and assessing threats to software systems. Another tool is IriusRisk, an open-source tool that can be used to model threats and risks in a collaborative manner.

												<h3>Week 5</h3>

												This text highlights the importance of industry specific security standards and directives in the context of security and risk assessments. The standards play a crucial role in ensuring the safety of sensitive information and mitigating potential risks. These standards also help organizations to stay compliant with regulatory requirements and maintain credibility in the market.

												Standards can greatly affect the outcome of security and risk assessments. Compliance with standards can help organizations to identify potential vulnerabilities and mitigate them before they can be exploited. Standards such as ISO/IEC 27001 and NIST SP 800-53 provide guidelines for implementing effective security controls, while regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA outline specific requirements for data protection and privacy.

												Common industry and enterprise standards include ISO/IEC 27001, NIST SP 800-53, PCI DSS, HIPAA, and GDPR. These standards are widely recognized and adopted by organizations across various industries.

											<p>
												I have made a significant contribution to the report, including coming up with most of the findings and recommendations. Below is a high-level summary of the report<br><br>
												The Risk Identification Report identifies potential risks that could impact Pampered Pets, a business considering digitalization to enhance internal processes and expand internationally. The report highlights that digitalization can lead to increased sales and revenue growth, but it also comes with its own set of threats and challenges. The potential risks identified include online security risks, supply chain risks, and customer retention risks. The report recommends several risk mitigation measures, including the investment in robust cybersecurity measures, careful selection of suppliers, and the provision of online features to prevent customer loss.<br><br>
